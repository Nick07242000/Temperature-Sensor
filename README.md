# Temperature Sensor

Project developed for FCEFYN - Digilat Electronics III final assignment.

## Description

Fully developed in C, the program consist of a temperature sensor ARM program, especifically developed for the NXP LPC1769 microcontroller.

## Features

- ADC: Analog input temperature signal conversion to digital value.
- DAC: Alarm sound based on temperature read.
- DMA: Direct peripherical to memory transfer from ADC to SRAM.
- UART: USB communication to external ruby program in order to convert the read temperature.
